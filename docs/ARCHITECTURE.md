# Architecture

Helios is a Cargo workspace with a Python sidecar and a TypeScript viewer.
This document is the deeper version of the architecture sketch in the
README. It explains every crate, the data flow from Terraform JSON to a
verified fix, and the boundary between deterministic and AI-driven layers.

## The five Rust crates

### `helios-graph`

Reads `terraform show -json` output and builds a `petgraph::DiGraph<R, D>`
keyed on Terraform addresses (e.g. `aws_subnet.public_a`). Eighteen resource
kinds: `aws_vpc`, `aws_subnet`, `aws_instance`, `aws_lb`, `aws_db_instance`,
`aws_elasticache_cluster`, `aws_lambda_function`, `aws_s3_bucket`,
`aws_rds_cluster`, `aws_rds_cluster_instance`,
`aws_elasticache_replication_group`, `aws_ecs_cluster`, `aws_ecs_service`,
`aws_eks_cluster`, `aws_eks_node_group`, `aws_sqs_queue`, `aws_vpc_endpoint`,
`aws_nat_gateway`; nine more (subnet groups, event source mappings, route
tables and their associations, IAM roles) are read only to resolve edges.
Edges are derived structurally:

- `Contains(via_attr)` -- e.g. `subnet -> vpc` via `vpc_id`.
- `MemberOf(via_attr)` -- e.g. `alb -> subnet` via `subnets`.
- `Spread(via_attr)` -- one member of a placement group: every Spread edge
  out of a resource with the same `via` is one group (an ECS service's
  subnets, an Aurora cluster's instances).
- `Egress(via_attr)` -- `subnet -> NAT gateway` via the default route
  (`nat_gateway_id`): compute in the subnet loses egress with the NAT; the
  subnet and non-compute resources do not.

Each resource also records what the graph could not determine: `unresolved`
(a zone-deciding attribute names nothing Helios can place -- zone outages in
its region become inconclusive), `inexact` (a plan reference linked every
candidate -- the group is evaluated worst case), `pending_principals` (plan
roles) and `sensitive_values` (Terraform's mask, used to redact).

The distinction matters for the SMT encoding. `Contains` propagates failure
downward (a subnet failure forces every contained EC2 instance to fail).
`MemberOf` is mostly topology and does *not* propagate -- it would
over-constrain regional services. Two are read: an ALB with no declared
zones is down when all of its `subnets` are, and an in-VPC Lambda when all
of its `subnet_ids` are down or have lost egress (any of them, when a plan
could not say exactly which). A `Spread` group propagates by its
`helios_models::spread_rule`, read from the attrs at solve time:
`AnySurvivor` (down when every member is), `FailsIfAnyDown` (capacity 1 or
placement unknown: down when any member is) or `Ignore`. `Egress` is read
only by compute in the subnet (a subnet's own `down` never reads it). The
edges a resource's `down` reads -- `Contains`, `Spread` and the two read
`MemberOf`s -- must be acyclic (`Error::DependencyCycle`); a cycle that
only an over-connected plan reference closes is dropped with a warning.

A saved plan (`terraform show -json <planfile>`) is read from
`planned_values`; an attribute unknown until apply is resolved through the
`configuration` block's `references` (a specific instance, else the
same `count.index` / `each.key`, else every instance).

### `helios-models`

Pure-data crate. `availability_for(tf_type, attrs, default_region)` returns
an `AvailabilityModel` for a resource:

```rust
enum AvailabilityModel {
    SingleAz { az: String },
    MultiAz { azs: Vec<String>, failover_seconds: Range<u32> },
    Regional { region: String },
    GlobalEdge,
}
```

Authoring a new resource type means adding a branch here. The crate has
zero external dependencies and is the easiest place for contributors to
land their first PR.

### `helios-engine`

The simulator. Splits across:

- `smt.rs` -- the `Encoder`. One `Bool` constant per resource, per AZ, per
  region. Biconditionals from `AvailabilityModel`: a `MultiAz` resource
  fails iff *all* its AZs fail; a `Regional` resource fails iff its region
  fails; a `SingleAz` resource fails iff its AZ fails. `Contains` edges
  add `child.failed -> parent_member.failed` propagation.
- `scenario.rs` -- `ScenarioKind` enum: `RegionOutage`, `AzOutage`,
  `IamRevocation`, `SlowRdsFailover`, `SingleNatDeath`. `apply_scenario`
  asserts the scenario's predicates onto the solver context.
- `simulate.rs` -- the top-level entry point. `simulate(graph, scenario)
  -> FailureChain`.
- `report.rs` -- `FailureChain { failures: Vec<FailedResource> }`.
- `fix.rs` -- `FixProposal { scenario_name, explanation, edits:
  Vec<FixEdit::SetAttr> }`. `apply_fix(graph, fix) -> ResourceGraph`
  clones the petgraph and mutates per-node attrs.
- `verify.rs` -- `verify(graph, scenario, fix) -> VerifyReport { pre_fix,
  post_fix, resolved, new_failures, remaining }`. BTreeSet diff over the
  failure-id sets.
- `inspect.rs` -- the `helios inspect` data flatten. Hand-rolled
  `{nodes, edges, scenario, chain}` shape -- not petgraph's native serde,
  because petgraph encodes `NodeIndex` integers that are unstable across
  builds and meaningless to a viewer.

`z3 0.20` ships as the `gh-release` feature, which bundles a precompiled
Z3 4.16.0 binary for both Linux and Windows. No system Z3 install needed.

### `helios-cli`

Six subcommands:

- `helios plan <tf-json-dir>` -- print the source (`state` or `plan`) and
  resource and edge counts.
- `helios propose-fix <tf-json> --scenario <yaml>` -- simulate, then pipe
  the chain and the scrubbed attrs of the failed resources to
  `python -m helios_ai propose-fix`; prints the FixProposal JSON.
- `helios simulate <tf-json> --scenario <yaml> [--json]` -- run the engine,
  print or emit the chain. Exits non-zero on any failure.
- `helios explain` -- read `FailureChain` JSON on stdin, shell out to
  `python -m helios_ai explain` for the markdown narration.
- `helios verify <tf-json> --scenario <yaml> --fix <json>` -- run the
  pre/post diff. Exits non-zero if anything still fails.
- `helios inspect <tf-json> --scenario <yaml>` -- emit the combined
  `{scenario, graph, chain}` JSON for the Action and viewer. Always exits
  zero.

### `helios-aws`

Stub crate. Will hold the live-state ingestion path (AWS API responses
merged into the graph for drift detection). Not implemented.

## The Python shell (`helios-ai/`)

A small uv-managed Python 3.12 package. Two commands on the same stdio
shape:

- `python -m helios_ai explain` -- input: `FailureChain` JSON. Output:
  markdown.
- `python -m helios_ai propose-fix` -- input: `{chain, attrs_snapshot}`
  JSON. Output: `FixProposal` JSON.

Both call the synchronous `anthropic.Anthropic` client with two cache
breakpoints (system persona + availability-model glossary). Set
`HELIOS_AI_MOCK=1` to swap in `MockAnthropic` -- the mock emits ASCII-only
text so Windows cp1252 stdout does not mangle JSON for the Rust
consumer.

The Python types in `models.py` mirror the Rust types byte-for-byte:
`FailureChain`, `FailedResource`, `FixProposal`, `FixEdit`. `extra="forbid"`
keeps schema drift loud.

## The web viewer (`web/`)

Vite 5 + React 18 + TypeScript 5 + cytoscape 3.30. Single-page app. Loader
is pure JSON validation. The Graph component is a `useEffect`-mounted
cytoscape canvas with kind-keyed pastels, failed resources red, `Contains`
edges thick + solid, `MemberOf` edges thin + dashed, `Spread` edges medium +
dotted, breadthfirst layout.

The viewer is local-only: file picker, paste-textarea, "Load sample"
button. Workflow-artifact deep-linking via `?artifact=<url>` is not
implemented.

## The GitHub Action (`action/`)

Composite action. Inputs: `scenarios-glob`, `fixes-dir`, `terraform-json`,
`github-token`, `artifact-name`. Steps:

1. `actions/cache@v4` keyed on `Cargo.lock` + crate sources.
2. Cache miss -> `cargo build --release --bin helios` -> copy to
   `${{ github.action_path }}/bin/helios`.
3. `action/scripts/run-scenarios.sh` -- loops the glob, writes
   `<stem>.json` per scenario plus `<stem>.verify.txt` if
   `fixes/<stem>.json` exists.
4. `action/scripts/build-comment.sh` -- jq-aggregates the per-scenario
   summaries into one `<details>`-collapsible markdown body marked with
   `<!-- helios-action -->`.
5. `actions/upload-artifact@v4` uploads the per-scenario JSON dir.
6. `action/scripts/post-sticky.sh` -- `gh api --paginate` lists comments,
   matches the marker, PATCHes if found else POSTs. Idempotent.

The marker is the literal `<!-- helios-action -->` on the first line. One
PR -> one comment, every push.

                helios-cli verify  -->  exit 0 or 1
```

The deterministic path is everything in Rust. Claude appears only at the
two `propose-fix` and `explain` arrows. See `docs/ai-boundary.md` for the
boundary rule and how `helios verify` enforces it.

## Why these choices

- **Z3 not a custom solver.** Industry-grade, well-documented, both Rust
  and Python bindings. We do not want to debug a custom DPLL.
- **petgraph not a custom graph.** Standard library for graph algorithms in
  Rust. The hand-rolled `inspect` shape exists only for serialization.
- **Composite Action not Docker / JS action.** Zero Node deps in the
  runtime; runs the same `gh` and `bash` the user already has;
  `actions/cache` for the prebuilt binary.
- **uv not pip.** Lockfile-based, fast, deterministic resolves.
- **Hand-rolled flat graph JSON for `inspect`.** petgraph's native serde
  encodes `NodeIndex` integers; useless to a viewer.

## Where to land your first PR

- A new resource kind: add a branch to `helios-models::availability_for`,
  add a fixture under `fixtures/<your-kind>/`, add a unit test.
- A new scenario kind: add a `ScenarioKind` variant in
  `helios-engine/src/scenario.rs`, an `apply_scenario` arm, a YAML fixture,
  a fixture-based integration test.
- A docs fix: PRs against `docs/` need only `cargo doc` and `lychee` to
  pass.
